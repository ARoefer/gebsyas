# gebsyas
This repository contains the geometry based symbolic agent system. Its goal is to connect symbolic logic and geometry as closely as possible.

# Documentation
I started writing documentation at some point, but it is by no means complete. Currently I am working on rebuilding the entire system using the lessons learned from the first implementation. For the time being, the documentation explaining some thoughts and concepts behind gebsyas is still available here: https://aroefer.github.io/gebsyas/
